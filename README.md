# JS-DSA-UDEMY
This is my repository for notes and problems as I work through the udemy course JavaScript [Algorithms & Data Structures Masterlass by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/?srsltid=AfmBOoru1JqPk9wjygLlwtV3ojfAYuKaSqtrZzI3IQnsKEMMkqZexreZ).

## Structure
Each Chapter will have a folder for notes as well as problems, examples, etc.
